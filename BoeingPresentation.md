# Corporate Beliefs - Ethics and compliance
##

<!-- TODO: Push image to the right -->
![](https://bit.ly/2Wc6Qrp, "Compliance Risk Management board"){width=30%}
- Speaking up <!-- <- Lawsuit -->
- Anti-Corruption Program <!-- <- Lawsuit -->
<!-- ^ Talking points ^
At Boeing, their stance on ethical business conduct is simple: do the right thing, every time, no exceptions. (737 Max 8 tells me this is a lie..) 
Doing the right thing for our employees, customers, stakeholders and communities has helped us earn trust and build partnerships that will drive us forward in our next century, and beyond. <-lol

- Leadership Matters: Initiative that focuses on enabling a culture of openness and accountability in order to sustain an ethical and compliant work environment and enhance business performance

- Compliance: To ensure that Boeing maintains effectiveness in the ongoing success of the company, compliance monitoring and assessments are built into all levels of the business.

- Boeing believes speaking up is a cornerstone for building an open and accountable workplace culture. Some of the confidential and anonymous methods(when preferred) include contacting local ethics advisors, toll-free phone numbers, accessing web-based portals, etc..


Creating this type of environment where employees are comfortable raising issues and concerns without fear of retaliation enables openness which leads to improved business performance and inspire greater innovation. (a couple recent lawsuits tell me this is a lie..)

- Anti-Corruption Program: Boeing strictly forbids bribery and corruption of any kind. It is imperative that we compete on the merits alone. Integrity is a core company value. This guidance is clear that we must never sacrifice our ethical principles to win or keep business—that no business is worth it.(supporting the saudi's tell me this is a lie..)

# Negative Press and Lawsuits
- New lawsuit alleges that Boeing put profit over people with 737 Max
  - 737 MAX 8 MCAS elevation angle correction errors leading to 2 crashes(346 deaths) and the banning of the plane in many countries  

<!-- 
- Boeing launched the 737 MAX with a critical software error
- The engines of the 737 are placed higher up on the wing to give them the clearance they needed
- During takeoff, the nose tended to point to far upward
- A plane that is flying upward at an angle like that can stall
- The MCAS tries to correct that upward angle using software
- the two gauges that report the angle of the plane reported DIFFERENT NUMBERS
- This causes the MCAS to engage too frequently, and at incorrect times. The pilots spend most of the flight trying to fight the upward and downward pitching of the plane
- until the plane's angle becomes too much and it stalls, or becomes too negative and nose dives to the ground

- South Carolina Factory producing 787 Dreamliners  
  - Production very rushed, safety concerns ignored by mgmt
  - Metal shavings, string of lights and a ladder all left inside the bodies of planes that the Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.) took on test flights
<!-- Talk about their corporate beliefs from the previous slide where they said they were promoting a safe work environment -->
  
- Boeing Co. was accused of negligence tied to a wildfire that tore through Malibu, California, in November and that purportedly started on the grounds of the nearby, disused Rocketdyne testing site.
<!-- The site was abandoned and Boeing wasn't taking any steps to keep the site safe from dry brush buildup. The Fire killed 3, burned about 100,000 acres and 
destroyed 1,500 structures in and around Malibu -->

# Negative Press and Lawsuits (cont'd)
- "Boeing employee wins racial harassment, discrimination lawsuit against company, which has 5 lawsuits on the way", 15 Jul 2018
  <!-- Boeing says proper corporate channels weren't followed, but doesn't deny the descrimination of the employee -->

- Boeing wrongfully fired an employee who sounded alrms over repeated alleged safety violations
<!-- This firing was for an employee at the North Carolina Dreamliner factory, for a company that says safety is a priority and workers should be able to speak their mind
they sure haven't been letting employees speak their mind about safety concerns -->
  
- Boeing to pay $57 million to settle a lawsuit in which employees accused the company of mismanaging their 401(k) retirement plans
