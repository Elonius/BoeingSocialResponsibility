The commitment to environmental leadership is seen in energy efficient products and services that set the standard for reductions in fuel use, emissions and community noise. It’s in the way we operate our factories, offices and other facilities. Over the past five years, Boeing reduced greenhouse gases, water use, hazardous waste and solid waste sent to landfill by up to 26 percent.
Looking ahead, Boeing’s business will be guided by a bold new strategy that further improves our environmental performance and footprint. It includes investing in advanced technologies, such as hybrid-electric aircraft propulsion, biofuel and chemical alternatives. 
The new strategy includes performance targets that will lead to substantial improvements in the company’s environmental footprint: <EnvironmentalTarget.png>

- Speaking up <- Lawsuit
- Anti-Corruption Program <- Lawsuit
<!-- ^ Talking points ^
At Boeing, our stance on ethical business conduct is simple: do the right thing, every time, no exceptions. (737 Max 8 tells me this is a lie..) 
Doing the right thing for our employees, customers, stakeholders and communities has helped us earn trust and build partnerships that will drive us forward in our next century, and beyond. <-lol
Ensuring that Boeing’s enduring values remain foundational to our work requires a daily commitment from every employee. Our robust ethics and compliance program is focused on integrity, respect, accountability and inclusion—the same values that lead to strong business outcomes. 

- Leadership Matters: Initiative that focuses on anabling a culture of openness and accountability in order to sustain an ethical and compliant work environment and enhance business performance

- Compliance: To ensure that Boeing maintains effectiveness in the ongoing success of the company, compliance monitoring and assessments are built into all levels of the business.

- Boeing believes speaking up is a cornerstone for building an open and accountable workplace culture, and creating this type of environment where employees are comfortable raising issues and concerns without fear of retaliation enables openness which leads to improved business performance and inspire greater innovation. Some of the confidential and anonymous methods(when preferred) include contacting local ethics advisors, toll-free phone numbers, accessing web-based portals, etc..

- Anti-Corruption Program: Boeing strictly forbids bribery and corruption of any kind. It is imperative that we compete on the merits alone. Integrity is a core company value. This guidance is clear that we must never sacrifice our ethical principles to win or keep business—that no business is worth it.(supporting the saudi's tell me this is a lie..)
