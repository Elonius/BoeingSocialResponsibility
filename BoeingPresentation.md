# Corporate Beliefs
## Boeing's vision
Over the past century, generations of talented Boeing employees helped build the world’s largest aerospace company—and shaped the course of history along the way. The Boeing Vision is an expression of our company’s purpose and values, designed to inspire and focus all employees on a shared future and to reaffirm that, together, we can meet the challenges that lie ahead.

This year, Boeing has adopted a new environment strategy to guide the company’s business through 2025 as it continues to:
Design, manufacture and deliver innovative aerospace products and services that will improve the company’s environmental footprint.
Strive for excellence in sustainability in our operations and supply base.
Inspire collaboration with partners around the world to advance innovative solutions for local and global environmental needs.
The new strategy includes performance targets that will lead to substantial improvements in the company’s environmental footprint: <EnvironmentalTarget.png>


## Environmental:
The commitment to environmental leadership is seen in energy efficient products and services that set the standard for reductions in fuel use, emissions and community noise. It’s in the way we operate our factories, offices and other facilities. Over the past five years, Boeing reduced greenhouse gases, water use, hazardous waste and solid waste sent to landfill by up to 26 percent.
Looking ahead, Boeing’s business will be guided by a bold new strategy that further improves our environmental performance and footprint. It includes investing in advanced technologies, such as hybrid-electric aircraft propulsion, biofuel and chemical alternatives.

## Ethics and compliance
At Boeing, our stance on ethical business conduct is simple: do the right thing, every time, no exceptions.  <--lol
Ensuring that Boeing’s enduring values remain foundational to our work requires a daily commitment from every employee. Our robust ethics and compliance program is focused on integrity, respect, accountability and inclusion—the same values that lead to strong business outcomes.

## Human Rights
### Non-Discrimination and Harassment
It is the policy of The Boeing Company to attract and retain the best qualified people available without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.
### Environment, Health & Safety
We are committed to providing employees with a safe and healthful workplace, protecting the environment wherever we conduct business and striving for excellence in safety, health and environment stewardship.
### Work Environment and Compensation
We are committed to promoting a work environment that fosters communication, productivity, creativity, teamwork, and employee engagement. As a global company, we seek to provide employees with compensation and benefits that are fair and equitable for the type of work and geographic location (local market) where the work is being performed, and competitive with other world-class companies.
### Slavery, Human Trafficking, Forced labor and Child labor
Boeing believes that the employment relationship should be voluntary, and the terms of employment must comply with applicable laws and regulations. We are therefore opposed to slavery, human trafficking, forced labor and child labor and are committed to complying with applicable laws prohibiting such exploitation.

## Diversity and Inclusion
The company's commitment to diversity means providing a work environment for all employees that is welcoming, respectful and engaging, with opportunities for personal and professional development. This in turn increases productivity, quality, creativity and innovation.
Boeing has a formal, company-wide diversity strategy, mission and goals, which guide a variety of internal programs and events. Our business excellence reaches new heights every day ... powered by Boeing people.
